# enhanced-preprints-import-controller

This is a UI built to make manual article import easy for humans outside the tech team.

To run the application for development purposes, you need to spin up the local version of epp-import with real s3 as a source. Then run `yarn start:dev`, and go to `localhost:5000`.

The manuscript import form will be available at `localhost:5000/input`.
